	__builtin_popcount(n)

for recursion , make sure the result is carried upwards 

Final 450 playlist : Stack n queue, heap , greedy , array , linked list, string, DP, Graph , bit manipulation

for generating list, construct a boolean recursion

for greedy , consider a minm variable t, make sure all elements satisfy conditions for constant t. This determines the ordering.

for minimum steps in graph problem , use bfs instead of dfs

for binary search , choose n and consider if problem statement is satisfied for that n


for question A :  always some trickery in solved cases to throw you off the approach , if seems difficult, there is always a particular trick to solve it .
else should have been B or C
